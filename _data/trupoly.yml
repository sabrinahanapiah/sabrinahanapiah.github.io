- title: Trupoly website
  project-description: Trupoly provides an easy, hassle-free way to compile and deliver individualized investment information to clientele. As a Junior Front-End Developer for RCS Capital, there were two main responsiblities, develop parts of the main site's redesign and create new interfaces for the investor's side. Here I worked closely with the back-end developer to ensure that the front-end code was acceptable to hand off to the Ruby on Rails backend.
