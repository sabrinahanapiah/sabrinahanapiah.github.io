- title: Spotify Player Web API
  project-description: This is a minimal visualization using Spotify's API. This app makes calls to Spotify endpoints to grab the current playing song. It renders the JSON data to display the title, artist and current position of the song, which is then synced with a music progress bar. Two of the last playing songs also appear below.
  secondary-link: Because Spotify's access tokens refresh every hour, I've coded the call for a refresh token every 50 minutes in the background to ensure a seamless experience. To see the example visual player, you must be logged into Spotify, playing a song.
