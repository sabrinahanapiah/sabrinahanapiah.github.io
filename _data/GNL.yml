- title: Global Net Lease website
  project-description: One of my main projects at RCS Capital was to code a new, responsive website for Global Net Lease (NYSE:GNL), a real estate investment trust. Special attention were paid to content organization, user experience, cross-browser compatibility, SEO and timeliness as GNL is a public REIT. Since this was a content-rich website, one of the toughest challenges were to come up with solutions on how to best present content from a Powerpoint (graphs, charts, tables) on a website and organize it in a way that users aren't overwhelmed by the information. The solutions focused on refining typographical hierarchy and placing content in tabs and panels.
