- title: Crowdjoy
  project-description: CrowdJoy (now acquired) was a mobile app that helped attendees navigate the crowds at events. I was the front-end developer leading the development of CrowdJoy's marketing site, making sure to maintain code that was clean, readable, and accessible within a huge site. Other works for this client included customizing HTML email templates and updating the CrowdJoy web app using React, SASS and other technologies.
