- title: Skywalls website
  project-description: One of my projects at Mind Your Design was to code a new, responsive website for Skywalls, an architectural walls system company. With design mockups, I built a pixel-perfect website that implement features such as a page preloader, responsive image carousels, 'ken burns' transitions, and more.
