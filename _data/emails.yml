- title: HTML emails
  project-description: I've worked with companies such as Conde Nast, Jet.com, NYRR and Pvolve, leading the email production of marketing and lifecycle campaigns. From leading a company's transition to responsive, mobile-friendly email templates, to building design systems, troubleshooting and ensuring consistent rendering across email clients and devices, and implementing personalization and dynamic content, I bring extensive experience in HTML email coding.
