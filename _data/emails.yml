- title: HTML emails
  project-description: I've worked with companies such as Conde Nast, Jet.com, NYRR and Pvolve, leading the email production of marketing and lifecycle campaigns. From spearheading a company's email transition to using responsive, mobile friendly email templates to debugging and ensuring emails render the same across email clients and devices to supporting personalization and dynamic content use cases, I have a multitude of HTML email coding experience.
