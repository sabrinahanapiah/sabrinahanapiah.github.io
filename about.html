				<p>I graduated in 2014 with a Bachelor's in Information Technology from Penn State University. My studies focused on web and mobile development with a minor in design. Frustrated in a lot websites being functional but not aesthetically pleasing, web development was a perfect way for me to visualize better interfaces and see it come to life through coding.</p>
				<p>I have a passion for learning and a curiosity for exploring new boundaries, and this keeps me updated on current web technologies. I pick things up quickly, know how to take criticism, and respond well to feedback all while performing in a demanding, fast-paced environment.</p>
				<p>When I'm not coding, you can find me traveling, dabbling in photography, collaborating with other creative minds, hanging out at coffee shops, eating nachos or biking.</p>
